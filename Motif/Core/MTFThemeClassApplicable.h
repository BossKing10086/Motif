/**
 MTFThemeClassApplicable is an abstract protocol that defines the methods and
 properties required to apply an MTFThemeClass from an MTFTheme to an object.
 
 You likely won't ever have to use an object that conforms to
 MTFThemeClassApplicable directly. The easiest way to register an applier is by
 using the `+[NSObject mtf_registerTheme...applierBlock:]` methods, which is a
 convenience method for creating and registering an applier that conforms to
 this protocol.
