 Applies this theme class to an object.
 
 When a theme class is applied to an object:
 
 1. A list of all of the properties on the class is generated using
    property_getAttributes from objc/runtime.h.
 2. This list of properties is compared to the class properties defined in the
    theme file.
 3. If any of the properties from the theme file have the same type as the
    properties on the class, the value from the theme file is set using
    key-value coding.
 4. If any of the matched properties have different types, an NSValueTransformer
    subclass if located transform the raw value to the type of the property,
    e.g. NSString â†’ UIEdgeInsets.
 5. The value from the above steps is set on the object using key-value coding.
 6. If there are no properties available for the theme property, its value is
    set on the object via key-value coding, which may throw an exception if the
    keypath is not implemented on the object.
